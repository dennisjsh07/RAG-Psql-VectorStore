       "AIMessage(content=\"It sounds like you’re trying to perform or learn about tracing tests in LangSmith. However, without specific details on what aspect you’re interested in, here’s a generalized approach:\\n\\n1. **Understanding LangSmith**: LangSmith is a tool or framework (hypothetical in this context since I don't have specific up-to-date information about a product by this name) that might be dedicated to linguistic processing, language model training, or computational linguistics.\\n\\n2. **Set Up Environment**:\\n   - Ensure you have your development environment set up with the necessary installations. This might include Python, relevant libraries, and LangSmith-specific packages.\\n\\n3. **Data Preparation**:\\n   - Gather and prepare your data for testing. This involves cleaning the data and formatting it according to the requirements of a tracing test.\\n\\n4. **Create Tracing Functions**:\\n   - Define the tracing functions or scripts. These would track specific linguistic features or processing paths within the LangSmith framework. \\n\\n5. **Integration**:\\n   - Integrate the tracing functionalities with your language models or processing pipelines. This might involve coding hooks or wrappers that interface with LangSmith’s APIs.\\n\\n6. **Running Tracing Tests**:\\n   - Execute the tests using sample inputs, ensuring the tracing outputs (like logs or metrics) are correctly capturing the intended processes.\\n\\n7. **Analyzing Results**:\\n   - Analyze the outputs to identify patterns, errors, or areas for improvement. Use this data to refine your models or processes.\\n\\n8. **Refinement and Iteration**:\\n   - Adjust your models or tracing code based on the findings. Iterate on testing to achieve more accurate and efficient results.\\n\\n9. **Documentation**:\\n   - Document your process, findings, and any changes made for future reference and reproducibility.\\n\\nIf LangSmith represents a different context or tool, please provide additional details so I can offer more tailored advice!\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 382, 'prompt_tokens': 11, 'total_tokens': 393, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_deacdd5f6f', 'id': 'chatcmpl-D1UsZjDXJpdbimZNJQE3m9B9LbeEy', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='lc_run--019bef7b-5e13-7190-a3e9-7fba3c2f79f1-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 11, 'output_tokens': 382, 'total_tokens': 393, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})"
